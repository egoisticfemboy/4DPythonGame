It's a simulation of a 4D world and how it could possible look like and work! 

# INFO ABOUT DIMENSIONS
A 1 Dimension is just one line, basicaly somethine where you need only one value to walk around (X axis). The 2 Dimension has the X axis and the Y axis wich makes it so it can only go up / down and left / right. A 3 Dimension has X axis, Y axis and Z axis. If we put a 3D person or object in a 2D world it would look like, for the 2D person, a object that changes their shape constantly so if we would put a 4D object in a 3D world we only could see a constantly shape changeing object. Another thing is, a person from 2D cant look through a 2D wall while we can so that would meana 4D person could look through our Walls. Theorie from Einstein is that the 4 Dimension is the time so they could control time but then we get into the grandfather paradox. The Grandfather paradox says if you travel through time  and kill your grandfather this would mean your father would never be born and you would disappear and this comes to a resolution your grandfather never died.
